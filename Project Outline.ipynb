    "Pollution, resource sustainability, and the climate change crisis have been major topics for years, but they have never been as significant as they are now. There is a huge push around the world towards clean and renewable energy sources to combat climate change. However, there is still uncertainty regarding the economic feasibility of switching to clean energy sources, especially for developing countries. I am optimistic that this dataset will lead us toward a better understanding of the economic feasibility of using clean energy for different countries at any point in their economic timeline.\n"

    "**Possible Finding and Implication**: Countries with higher GDP per capita would have a higher share of renewable electricity resources, as well as access to electricity and clean fuels for cooking. This would support our assumption that countries with smaller economies are hesitant in switching to renewable energy due to costs.<br>\n",

    "**Possible Finding and Implication**: The Middle East and neighboring Asian countries/allies will likely use more fossil fuels due to how abundant it is in those regions. European countries have likely seen a large increase in renewable energy usage over the years due to the increase of environmental initiatives and recently implemented climate laws. Outside of these regions, we believe that the source of energy in other countries will depend on the economic status of these regions/nations (wealthier countries will use cleaner, more expensive energy sources whereas developing countries will be cutting on costs and using more affordable energy sources).\n",
