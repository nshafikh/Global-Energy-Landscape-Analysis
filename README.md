# Global Energy Landscape Analysis

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global energy consumption trends, electricity access, and the impact of income levels on energy use, with a focus on the evolving role of renewable and fossil energy sources across different regions and income brackets from 2000 to 2020.

## Key Areas of Analysis

The analysis is broken down into the following key areas:

1. **Access to Electricity by Income Bracket**
2. **Total Energy Consumption Across Income Brackets**
3. **Per Capita Energy Consumption by Income Bracket**
4. **Renewable Energy’s Share in Total Consumption**
5. **Income-Based Distribution of Global Electricity Consumption by Energy Source**
6. **Distribution of Electricity Sources Within Each Income Bracket**

## Key Insights

- **Electricity Access:**  
  Low-income countries experience significant gaps in electricity access, with just over 30% of their populations gaining access during the period analyzed (2000-2020). 

- **Energy Consumption:**  
  High-income countries vastly outpace low-income countries in total energy consumption and per capita energy usage, reflecting disparities in both energy availability and consumption patterns.

- **Renewable Energy:**  
  An inverse relationship exists between income levels and reliance on renewable energy. Low-income countries, due to limited access to other energy sources, rely heavily on renewable energy, while high-income countries use far less.

- **Nuclear Energy:**  
  High-income countries dominate global nuclear energy consumption, accounting for over 85% of the supply. The disparity is especially striking in comparison to lower-income regions, which have minimal nuclear energy usage.

- **CO₂ Emissions:**  
  Upper-middle-income countries, especially China, have seen the largest growth in CO₂ emissions, surpassing high-income countries in recent years. This trend highlights the impact of rapid industrialization and economic growth on global emissions.

## Visualizations

The project includes a series of visualizations that provide insights into:

- Disparities in electricity access across income brackets.
- The difference in energy consumption between high and low-income countries.
- Trends in renewable energy adoption across different income groups.
- The relationship between income levels and the energy mix, particularly in relation to fossil fuels, renewables, and nuclear energy.

## Additional Research

- **BloombergNEF:**  
  A significant push for renewable energy is underway in developing countries, driven by rising fossil fuel prices and the need to mitigate climate change impacts. Developing nations are increasingly ambitious in their clean power policies to reduce energy poverty and enhance sustainability.

- **The Rockefeller Foundation:**  
  Renewable energy initiatives can potentially generate up to **500 million new jobs** in Africa and Asia by 2030, providing significant economic opportunities while combating energy poverty.

- **World Nuclear Association:**  
  The long-term incentives for nuclear energy are often hampered in deregulated markets due to high capital investment requirements and greater uncertainty. Despite this, nuclear energy remains a crucial part of the energy mix in high-income countries.

## Conclusion

This project sheds light on the profound disparities in global energy access and consumption, highlighting the growing importance of renewable energy and the role of economic development in shaping the future energy landscape. It underscores the need for targeted policies that address energy poverty, promote sustainability, and reduce emissions, particularly in developing countries. The additional research suggests that financial investments, technological advancements, and policy changes will be pivotal in driving global energy transitions, mitigating climate change, and ensuring equitable energy access worldwide.
