## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global energy consumption trends, electricity access, and the impact of income levels on energy use, with a focus on the evolving role of renewable and fossil energy sources across different regions and income brackets during a two-decade span.

## Data

- Primary Dataset: Sustainable Energy 2000-2020
- URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/global-data-on-sustainable-energy/data
- This dataset contains many useful factors, including sustainable energy indicators, across 176 countries from 2000 to 2020
- 1 table
- 21 columns
- 3520 rows (176 countries * 20 years)
- There are some columns (e.g., financial flows to developing countries) that have missing values. We will determine how to handle missing values upon further examination of the dataset.
- Additionally using World Bank dataset to identify population and age brackets for countries
- Income URL: https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups
- Population URL: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL

## 3 Conclusion
The analysis of global energy consumption trends, the composition of electricity sources, and the relationships between
income levels, renewable energy adoption, and CO₂ emissions paints a complex picture of the evolving energy
landscape. Several key insights emerged from the exploration:

1. **Income and Energy Consumption:** The disparity between high income and low income countries is evident in
both total energy consumption and electricity access. High income nations consistently dominate global energy
usage, while low income countries continue to depend heavily on renewable energy due to limited access to
fossil fuels. This underscores the challenge of energy poverty, especially in low income regions where limited
access to traditional energy resources has led to a reliance on renewables as a means of addressing energy
needs.
2. **Renewable Energy Adoption:** Financial inflows aimed at boosting renewable energy usage in developing
countries have had a measurable impact, though their effectiveness has been tempered by the faster growth in
consumption from other energy sources. Countries receiving financial support for renewable energy showed
consistent increases in renewable electricity consumption, suggesting that financial aid can catalyze change.
However, other factors, such as the growth of fossil fuel-based energy consumption and the higher cost of
renewables, have slowed the transition.
3. **Regional Trends and Nuclear Energy:** The regional analysis revealed stark differences in how electricity is
sourced. While Eastern Asia and North America remain major consumers of fossil fuels and nuclear energy,
Latin America has been a leader in renewable energy adoption. The specific case of Eastern Asia, particularly
China, illustrates the significant role industrialization and rapid economic growth play in shifting energy
consumption patterns. As noted in the additional research, East Asia’s decline in nuclear energy usage in the
early 2010s was a direct result of the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, but this was later reversed as China
and other countries in the region sought to increase their nuclear capacity in response to rising energy demand
and climate concerns. Furthermore, regions like Western Europe show a marked preference for nuclear energy,
despite a general decline in its usage over the past two decades.
4. **CO₂ Emissions and Economic Growth:** High income countries, long the largest CO₂ emitters, have recently
been surpassed by upper-middle income nations, particularly China, whose rapid industrialization and
economic growth have driven a sharp increase in emissions. This trend is consistent with the findings that
suggest a direct link between economic growth and CO₂ output. However, in high income countries, total
emissions have stabilized, and per capita emissions have declined, as many of these nations have moved
toward cleaner energy solutions. This trend highlights the potential for decoupling economic growth from
carbon emissions when cleaner technologies are adopted, a shift that has been aided by the international
policies and frameworks discussed in the additional research.
5. **Role of International Financial Flows:** The additional research from sources like the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the Rockefeller Foundation underscored the
importance of international investment in clean energy, especially in developing countries. While financial
inflows are vital, they are still not sufficient to meet the scale of energy transition required. UNCTAD has
called for greater investments in clean energy projects, while the Rockefeller Foundation emphasized the
significant job creation potential of ending energy poverty through renewable energy initiatives. These insights
point to the need for coordinated global efforts, including increased funding, to accelerate the energy transition
in developing regions.
6. **Nuclear Energy's Role in the Energy Mix:** The additional research also highlighted the evolving role of nuclear
energy in the global energy mix. In Europe, nuclear energy has faced significant challenges, including public
perception issues and the high capital costs of building new plants. However, countries like France have
remained strong proponents of nuclear energy, which has helped to provide a stable, low-carbon source of
electricity. This contrasts with other regions like Italy, which phased out nuclear energy completely but still
supports nuclear initiatives in neighboring countries like France. These examples emphasize that while nuclear
energy is viewed with caution in many parts of the world, it remains an important part of the energy mix,
especially in countries that have made long-term investments in its infrastructure.
